# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome, and thank you for contributing to BlockModels! Here's how you do it:

## Step 1 - What do I add?

If you don't know what to add, it's recommended to play around and find things you want to improve by experimenting.
Still clueless? Pick an issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/theonlytails/blockmodels/issues).

## Step 2 - Forking and Cloning

To [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), click on the fork
button on the top right of your screen, and fork the repository.

Now that you have your own copy, make a new branch with a descriptive name (no, `new-feature` is not a descriptive name)
and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the
repository to your local environment.

## Step 3 - Write the Code

Just - do it. There's not much to detail here. Regarding code styling, stick to
the [official guidelines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) supplied by the Kotlin team. (Note: every
function, property and class must have [KDocs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html) attached)

## Step 4 - Make a Pull Request

Once you're done coding your new feature/bugfix, come back to your fork, and make a new Pull Request from your branch to
the [main branch](https://github.com/theonlytails/blockmodels/tree/main).

Before creating your PR, make sure to:

- Request a review from at least one of
  the [members of the triage team](https://github.com/TheOnlyTails/BlockModels/wiki/Triage-Team).
- Add a relevant label.
- If your PR is supposed to close an issue,
  add ["Closes #<issue number>"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (
  e.g., "Closes #3" for issue number 3) at the end of your PR message.

Now that you've created your PR, the reviewers will discuss the changes with you, and automated checks will run on your
code.
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to [enable *auto-squash and
merge*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request#enabling-auto-merge)
. Once it's enabled, your PR will be automatically merged once all checks pass and reviewers approve.

## Step #5 - Celebrate

Hurray! You've made your first contribution to BlockModels! ðŸŽ‰
